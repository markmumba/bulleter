climbing and falling tied up in the rhymes and reasons
no city, no spaces, no oceans can stand between us
When it gets heavy, sometimes I've got doubts
And I'm just trying keep these shadows out
I've been thinking myself to death
You're calling me home like a ship that got wrecked
I know there's always a place for you and I
A place where every word that you say, can save my life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Where nothing hurts and nothing breaks
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll know it when I see your face
I'm safe
Coping, collapsing the world tumbles down around us
This hoping and floating is grinding us down to stardust
When It get's heavy, I know you get doubts
But I'll be right here when the sky falls down
I've been thinking myself to death
You're calling me home like a ship that got wrecked
I know there's always a place for you and I
A place where every word that you say, can save my life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Where nothing hurts and nothing breaks
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll know it when I see your face
I'm safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'm safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When the rivers are rising, I'm safe
When I look in your eyes, I'm safe
When the rivers are rising, I'm safe
When I look in your eyes
I know there's always a place for you and I
A place where every word that you say, can save my life
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Where nothing hurts and nothing breaks
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I'll know it when I see your face
I'm safe
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When the rivers are rising, I'm safe (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
When I look in your eyes, I'm safe (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
When the rivers are rising, I'm safe (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
When I look in your eyes, I'm safe (Oh, oh, oh, oh)
